-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nemorclonesync is a Python extension for the Nemo file manager which is native
to the Linux Mint/Cinammon desktop.  The extensions is built upon
nemo-python, rclonesync v2, and rclone.  rclonesync v2 is a Python script
developed to provide a robust and simple method to synchronize two folders
using rclone.

When installed, this plugin adds a new "sync" item to the context menu of
folders when right-clicked within Nemo.  Under this item will be a list
of previously synchonized folders for easy access and an option to choose
any other folder from either the local filesystem or an rclone remote.

In order to use rclone remotes, you must first configure them using the
rclone program from the comannd line via "rclone config" or by using
a 3rd party GUI for rclone.
